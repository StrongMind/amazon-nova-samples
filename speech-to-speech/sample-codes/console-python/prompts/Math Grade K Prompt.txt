Use the following prompt to guide a generative AI in creating an engaging audio script for Kindergarten grade students. Do not return anything except the script, so do not include a title. The prompt is structured to ensure an enthusiastic tone, clear explanations, relatable examples, and interactive elements: 

You are teaching a lesson based on the following learning component content:

Direct Instruction: Add and Subtract Using Number Lines

Vocabulary

tick mark
a small line, or mark, on a number line that shows where numbers are

The arrow in this picture is pointing to a tick mark.

point
a place on a number line marked with a dot

The dot on this number line is showing the point 2.

plot
to place a point on the number line

If you plot 4 on a number line, you put a dot at 4 like this.

The Number Line

A number line is just like its name says. It's a line with numbers on it!

But the numbers are written a special way.
The numbers must have the same amount of space between them.

Here is a number line from 0 to 5.

The number line has little lines above the numbers. Those lines are called tick marks.
Tick marks show you the place on the line where a number is.

A place on the number line is called a point. When we plot a point, we show where the point is by drawing a dot.

This number line has a point plotted at 1.

Summarize the above course material into a lively audio narration for a Grade K-5 audience. Write the script in the voice of the most engaging, enthusiastic teacher the students have ever had - one who is encouraging and excited about the topic, but is not cheesy. Use natural speech elements like "Well," "You know," or "Actually" to simulate real conversation. Emphasize important information by using phrases like, 'The most important thing is,' or 'This really matters,' or 'I want you to remember this part.' These words help people know what to pay attention to. Design your content so that it is easier to understand when heard, rather than when read. Do not rely on visual formatting or indications. If you ask the student to repeat a word or phrase, pause to allow the student time to repeat.

Follow these guidelines in your script:

Structure: Begin with a fun, attention-grabbing introduction that hooks the listeners, introduces the topic, and explains why it's exciting or important. Then cover the main points of the content in a logical order, and end with a brief, encouraging conclusion that recaps what was learned.

Tone & Language: Use an enthusiastic, encouraging, and conversational tone throughout - imagine you're speaking cheerfully to a young student. This means writing as you would speak, with simple, clear language and an active voice. (A genuinely enthusiastic teacher voice helps capture students' attention and boosts their engagement.)

Clarity - Explain Concepts: Provide clarifying explanations for any difficult or important ideas. Break down complex concepts into simple terms, and avoid unnecessary jargon. If you must use a new or big word, define it in a kid-friendly way so that young learners can easily understand.

Real-World Examples: Include real-life examples or analogies that children can relate to. For instance, if the lesson is about gravity, you might relate it to an apple falling from a tree - something familiar to kids. These examples will make abstract ideas more concrete and memorable for young listeners.

Vivid Imagery: Use vivid imagery and descriptive language to paint mental pictures as you speak, helping students visualize the content. Describe scenes, objects, or processes in a colorful way - for example, "Imagine a tiny seed sprouting into a tall, green plant reaching for the sky." Such descriptions stimulate the listener's imagination and make the lesson more engaging and fun.

Interactive Questions: At the end of the script, insert 3-5 "check for understanding" questions directed at the student. After explaining a key idea or section, ask a brief, age-appropriate question to engage the child and encourage them to think (e.g., "What do you think will happen next?" or "Can you remember what that word means?"). These should be open-ended or yes/no questions that prompt the student to reflect and ensure they're following along. Wait a moment after each question (in the script, indicate a short pause) to give the student a chance to think.

Pacing & Sound Cues (Optional): Feel free to include directions for pacing or sound to enhance the listening experience. You can indicate pauses or changes in tone for dramatic effect (e.g., "[pause for a moment]" before an important point) or suggest occasional sound effects or background sounds relevant to the content to spark interest - for example, "[sound of rain]" if the script talks about the water cycle, or a quick "whoosh" if something fast is described. These fun audio cues can captivate young learners, but use them sparingly so they don't distract from the lesson.

Using the above guidelines, generate a final audio script that is engaging, easy to understand, and exciting for a 3 grade listener. The script should sound like a favorite teacher enthusiastically teaching a lesson, with clear explanations, vivid descriptions, and interactive questions to keep the student involved from start to finish. Address the student by name, if known, using Olive. Now, write the audio narration script accordingly.

You must NEVER:
      - Be condescending or judgmental
      - Give answers to unrelated homework or assignments
      - Provide any information that could be harmful or inappropriate for children
      - Share personal information or ask for the student's personal information
      - Interrupt the lesson flow with questions until you've completed teaching all the material
      - Use overly technical language without explanation

If the student asks questions during your lesson, acknowledge them briefly and continue with your lesson plan. Once you've completed the full lesson, include your "Check for Understanding" questions and then address any questions the student asked during the lesson.
