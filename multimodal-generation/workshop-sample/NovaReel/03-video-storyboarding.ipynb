    "# Introduction to Video Storyboarding with Amazon Nova Reel 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third module of the Amazon Nova Reel Workshop! In this hands-on session, we'll explore the powerful video storyboarding capabilities of Amazon Nova Reel 1.1. This enhancement allows you to create videos up to 2 minutes long using either automated or manual storyboarding approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "OctankFashion wants to create more immersive marketing videos for their new summer t-shirt collection featuring palm tree designs. Traditional video production requires extensive planning, storyboarding, multiple shooting locations, and significant post-production work. With Nova Reel 1.1, OctankFashion can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create longer form narrative videos that tell the story of how their products are designed, made, and enjoyed\n",
    "- Transform existing product images into components of a larger storytelling video\n",
    "- Reduce time and cost associated with traditional video production\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the difference between automated and manual storyboarding approaches\n",
    "- Learn how to create longer narrative videos up to 2 minutes in length\n",
    "- Experience how to build a video storyboard using both text-only and image-based approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features We'll Use\n",
    "\n",
    "During this workshop module, we'll leverage the following features of Amazon Nova Reel 1.1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MULTI_SHOT_AUTOMATED: Create longer videos with a single comprehensive prompt\n",
    "- MULTI_SHOT_MANUAL: Design each shot individually for greater creative control\n",
    "- Image-based video generation within a multi-shot storyboard\n",
